msys-setup
==========

My own setup of msysgit/msys/gnuwin32/config for Windows

This project is an install of Git for Windows portable v1.9.4-preview20140929 followed by install of msys and gnuwin32, reconfiguration, etc.

It is meant to be able to be updated easily to the latest version of git for windows while still having an expanded toolchain and better
configuration.
